# Face ALL-IN-ONE Recognition
This project is a collaboration between me and my friend Hoang (https://github.com/HuyHoangPhung/), when we worked together on a subject project in school.
Our goal was to design a facial recognition system that combines age, gender, and emotion, all in one frame. The main language is Python, the framework used to train the model is TensorFlow, the library to handle webcam and output is OpenCV
